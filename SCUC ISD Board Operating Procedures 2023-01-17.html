<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>In effective school systems, the Superintendent and the Board function as a “Team of Eight.” A structured approach to developing a vision for the District and setting goals is enhanced by first developing a system of standard operating procedures. The School Board is the corporate policy making body for the district and the Superintendent and staff provide the leadership to cause Board policies to be implemented. Therefore, the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD Board of Trustees and Superintendent function as a “TEAM OF EIGHT” to provide open communication to the staff and patrons of the district, within a structure of “Good Governance.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="board-governance">BOARD GOVERNANCE</h2>
<p>The SCUC ISD Board of Trustees is committed to a participative, process-driven Governance style. Board level decision-making processes shall therefore include the following elements to whatever extent is practical and appropriate for the matter at hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly stated objectives</p></li>
<li><p>Reconciliation with policy and established practice</p></li>
<li><p>Board approved parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Timelines</p></li>
<li><p>Data gathering</p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholder input</p></li>
<li><p>Communication plan</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each instance, staff shall facilitate the process and make recommendations with oversight and decision-making authority retained by the Board. Examples of decisions that fall under this umbrella include, but are not limited to, curriculum, budget, school year calendar, attendance zone realignment and facilities needs assessments.</p>
<p>It is the expectation of the Board that participative, process-driven decision-making should flow through the organization at each level as appropriate.</p>

<p>The purpose of placing Governance in the hands of the Board and management in the hands of the Superintendent is to ensure the community retains authority over the basic direction, priorities, and values embodied in the operation of the District while also making sure implementation is carried out by a trained professional with a wide range of experience. It also ensures that the Board has the advice of someone well- versed in the immense complexity of school district operations.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duties-of-the-board-govern-the-district">DUTIES OF THE BOARD: GOVERN THE DISTRICT</h2>
<p>In order to govern effectively; the Board should not take action on an item without first hearing the recommendation from the Superintendent (with exception of action affecting his/her own employment or one or more individual Trustees). The Board is never obligated to accept the Superintendent’s recommendation, but frequent denial of recommendations signals the Board and Superintendent need to review priorities and procedures to make sure no misunderstandings or failures in communications have occurred. Individual Board members must refrain from confusing their role with the role of the Superintendent and becoming involved in the day-to-day operations of the schools.</p>

<p>(Within the framework of Board policies and priorities)</p>
<p>The Superintendent functions as the educational leader and chief executive officer of the District and is, throughout the exercise of responsibilities, accountable to the Board of Trustees. The education and administrative leadership responsibilities of the Superintendent are complementary and interdependent with the public leadership, Governance, and policymaking responsibilities of the Board.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion and provide harmonious and progressive direction for the District, both Superintendent and Board must strive to keep the distinctions between their respective leadership roles clearly in mind (reference) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx48OqOMcV2SQ1VGeFVMR3R1X0E/view?resourcekey=0-MYa97DBIGlTjnOIyAiQPkg">Good Governance Model</a>.</p>
<p>The essential duties of the Superintendent include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accepting administrative responsibility and leadership for the planning, operation, supervision, and evaluation of the education programs, services, and facilities of the district and for the annual performance appraisal of the district’s staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting authority and responsibility for the assignment and evaluation of personnel and making recommendations for employment and termination of employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing and submitting to the Board a proposed budget.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="board-meetings">BOARD MEETINGS</h2>
<section id="placing-items-on-the-agenda" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="placing-items-on-the-agenda">Placing Items on the Agenda:</h3>
<p>The Board will maintain an agenda planning calendar. The agenda is created by the Superintendent and Board executive committee approximately a week and a half before the Board meetings. Any two Board members may request through the Board President or Superintendent any item they wish to have placed on a future agenda. In reviewing the preliminary agenda before posting, the Board President shall ensure that any topics the Board or any two individual Board members have requested to be addressed are either on that agenda or are scheduled for deliberation at an appropriate time in the near future, not to exceed 60 days.</p>
<p>In accordance with Texas open Meeting Act (TOMA), no agenda may be posted less than 72 hours in advance of a meeting, except in an emergency as per Texas Government Code. Each agenda item must be identified in sufficient detail that the general subject can be understood by the public, i.e.&nbsp;“<strong>Request for Board Discussion and Action – Appointment of a District Rezoning Committee</strong>”.</p>
</section>
<section id="posting-notice-of-agenda" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posting-notice-of-agenda">Posting Notice of Agenda:</h3>
<p>TOMA requires that the notice of a Board meeting be posted in a place “readily accessible” to the general public at all times. The SCUCISD notice of Board meetings is posted on an outside bulletin Board at the administration building at least seventy-two hours prior to the scheduled time of the meeting (at least two hours prior to the time of an emergency meeting). The notice of the meeting and agenda are posted on the website.</p>
</section>
<section id="board-packet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="board-packet">Board Packet:</h3>
<p>A packet is prepared each month for Board Members the week prior to the meeting. Along with the agenda, the packet includes documents that give a brief explanation of the items placed on the agenda. The packet may include financial statements, lists of bills payable, and other supporting data/explanatory documents so Board Members may have an opportunity to review the information before the meeting. If members have questions or concerns on any of these items, they are strongly encouraged to contact the Superintendent prior to the meeting in order to minimize confusion at the meetings. The agenda form is intended as a method to ensure organization and to conduct Board meetings in an efficient and timely manner.</p>
</section>
<section id="consent-agenda" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consent-agenda">Consent Agenda:</h3>
<p>Consent agenda items are routine items that may be acted on as a single item with one vote. These items may include but are not limited to annual contract renewals with Regions 13 &amp; 20, Texas Education Agency items, budget amendments, financial information, and minutes of recent Board meetings. A Trustee may request an item be pulled for separate discussion at the scheduled meeting.</p>
</section>
<section id="items-for-closed-session" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="items-for-closed-session">Items for Closed Session:</h3>
<p>Generally, personnel issues must be discussed in closed session, unless otherwise required by Texas open Meeting Act. The primary purpose behind a closed session for personnel matters is to protect the employee or student from possible unjustified harm to his/her reputation and to comply with the law. The provision for closed meetings applies only to deliberations concerning individual employees or students. TOMA requires that the subject matter of the closed meeting be set forth with sufficient particularity to notify the public of the matters under consideration. Merely stating that “litigation”, or “routine business,” will be discussed is insufficient. The agenda topic should be expanded/explained to give the interested reader a better idea of the issues to be discussed and decided. If a matter involves a class of employees, such as the salary of a group of employees, it should be deliberated in an open meeting. The Board can discuss only those items listed on the closed session agenda. Closed session discussions must remain confidential. No action may be taken during closed session. All action must be taken in open session.</p>
<p>Records must be kept of closed meetings as well. The Board must keep a Certified Agenda during closed session unless the closed meeting was for the purpose of consulting with an attorney. Typically, this is the duty of the Board Secretary. Participation in a closed meeting knowing that a Certified Agenda or audio recording is not being kept constitutes a Class C Misdemeanor. Even though the certified agenda is confidential and can be inspected only by court order, sufficient detail should be included in the certified agenda so that a reasonable person reading the agenda would understand the scope and nature of the items discussed at the closed session. The certified agenda or audio recording must be maintained for two years following the meeting.</p>
</section>
<section id="closed-session-confidentiality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="closed-session-confidentiality">Closed Session – Confidentiality:</h3>
<p>Trustees participating in closed sessions must consider the following provisions related to confidentiality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Confidentiality of Closed Session Record.* Certified agendas and tape recordings of the closed portion of the meeting are confidential, available for public inspection and copying only under a court order. Texas Gov’t Code §§ 55.o21 and 551.10 4(c); Tex. Att’y Gen.&nbsp;No.&nbsp;JM-995 (1988).</p></li>
<li><p>Confidentiality of other Closed Session Written Information.* Because of the nature of the Board’s work, Board members have a great deal of access to information that is confidential either temporarily or permanently. Until it is clear that a document reviewed or discussed in closed session is public, individual Board members have no authorization to release such documents. However, the fact that a document was shared and/or discussed in closed session does not protect it indefinitely. Rather, whether a document is confidential or public depends on the nature of the document itself. For example, an employee evaluation document is confidential by law permanently, while an application for a top-level job may be confidential only temporarily, until the position is filled or a certain period of time has expired.</p></li>
<li><p>Confidentiality of Closed Session oral Discussions.* Closed sessions have the purpose of allowing Board members to have frank discussions without concern about an off-hand comment or sensitive topic being revealed and possibly result in legal or other problems. Many sensitive closed session discussions, such as those related to individual employees regarding job performance, or the information being discussed may be preliminary and is likely to change. Any discussion authorized to be discussed in closed session about information not yet available to the public or staff should be limited to that closed session until and unless final action is considered and taken.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calling-meeting-to-order">Calling Meeting to Order:</h3>

</section>
<section id="voting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="voting">Voting:</h3>
<p>While the Board meetings are based on Robert’s Rules of order, the Board does observe parliamentary procedures for the voting process. only items listed on the agenda may be discussed at a Board meeting. All discussion shall be directed solely to the business currently under deliberation. The Board President has the responsibility to keep the discussion to the matter at hand and shall halt discussion that does not apply to the agenda item currently before the Board. The Board President will vote on all action items. The Board will clarify any specific criteria expected for staff reports. Agenda items listed as “Reports” are for discussion/briefing only and do not require a vote.</p>
</section>
<section id="public-comments-regular-board-meetings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-comments-regular-board-meetings">Public Comments – Regular Board Meetings:</h3>
<p>During regular Board Meetings, persons wishing to address the Board have the opportunity to do so during the “public comments” segment of the meeting by signing and making a request on the visitor registration sheet located inside the Board room. Public comments can be related to items on that meeting’s agenda or to non- agenda items.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Agenda Items.* Every person who signed up in the appropriate time period may address the Board on an agenda item, prior to the Board’s discussion and/or consideration of the item. Each speaker is limited to three minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-Agenda Items.* Public comments on non-agenda items will be heard early in the Board meeting. Each speaker is limited to three minutes. A total of thirty minutes per meeting may be allowed for public comments for non-agenda items. If more than five persons wish to address the same non-agenda topic, a spokesperson may be asked to speak for the group for one three-minute period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a member of the public asks a question about an item not listed on the published agenda, neither the Board nor the Superintendent may discuss the subject; however, the Superintendent or any member of the Board may respond by providing specific factual information, offering a recitation of existing policy, or by asking clarifying questions. Members may not discuss or deliberate the question.</p>
<p>Board Policy BED (Legal) states:o “Citizens shall have the right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble together for their common good and to apply to those invested with the powers of Government for redress of grievances or other purposes, by petition, address, or remonstrance. Tex. Const. Art. I, Sec. 27”</p>
<p>The Board strongly discourages inappropriate comments on individual personnel or students in public session. Complaints or concerns will be considered by the Board only after the complainant has followed the guidelines prescribed by the applicable policies, such as <a href="https://pol.tasb.org/PolicyOnline/PolicyDetails?key=551&amp;code=DGBA#legalTabContent">DGBA (Local)</a>, <a href="https://pol.tasb.org/PolicyOnline/PolicyDetails?key=551&amp;code=FNG#legalTabContent">FNG (Local)</a>, or <a href="https://pol.tasb.org/PolicyOnline/PolicyDetails?key=551&amp;code=GF#legalTabContent">GF (Local)</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="board-training-requirements">BOARD TRAINING REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>The SCUC ISD Board of Trustees recognizes the value of Board member training and supports involvement by Board members in local, state and national affairs on behalf of the District and public education in general.</p>
<p>New Board members shall, after they are sworn in, complete a District orientation within sixty days of the election or appointment with the Superintendent and a Board orientation with the Board President or appointee. Newly elected Trustees must receive 1 hour of training in the Texas open Meetings Act and Public Information Act within 90 days of their election or appointment. First year Trustees must have 10 hours training within the first year, which must include 3 hours of orientation in the Texas Education Code. Existing Trustees must receive 5 hours training per year prior to the December Board meeting. Any current Board member may attend or participate in the District orientation offered to new Board members.</p>
<p>If Board members intend to seek reimbursement for costs associated with out-of-state or out of the ordinary training, conferences, presentations, or other training involvement, the Board member must obtain pre-approval by the Board of Trustees. The request and motion should include the dates and location of the event, the purpose and benefit to SCUC or public education in general, the estimated total dollar amount of costs, including registration, travel, lodging, etc. The Board member will provide a summary report to the Board of Trustees at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting.</p>
<p>Unless approved in advance by the Board, no individual Trustee who has been censured by the Board or who has been found to have engaged in unethical practices, as determined by the Texas Ethics Commission, may represent the district at any Board training. Likewise, unless that Trustee requires specific training under state law and/or unless approved by the Board in advance, no district funds will be expended for costs associated with that Trustee’s Board training, conferences, presentations, or other similar involvement.</p>
<p>our School District is a member of TASB (Texas Association of School Boards). Training opportunities are offered throughout the year, and Trustees are encouraged to attend. TASB offers the Leadership TASB course, a five session course conducted over five weekends throughout the year. Trustees are encouraged to apply for the opportunity to attend Leadership TASB but must have at least two years remaining on their term of service for the Board to authorize district expenditures for this course.</p>

</ul>
<p>All three policies rely on the “Principal or Supervisor (Level I) – Superintendent or designee (Level II) – Board (Level III)” chain of command and resolution. A formal grievance procedure is used in which written complaints are filed first with the Principal or Supervisor, then the Superintendent if necessary. A presentation to the Board is the final step in the process.</p>
<p>At times, individuals will bring complaints before the Board during the public comments portion of a meeting. The Board is under no obligation to hear such complaints before administrative remedies have been pursued. The Board President should direct the person to the appropriate complaint process. Level III complaints are heard in Board meetings as scheduled agenda items, which allow the Board to take action on the complaint during the same meeting.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="addressing-public-concerns-outside-of-the-board-room">ADDRESSING PUBLIC CONCERNS OUTSIDE OF THE BOARD ROOM</h2>
<p>Board Members are often confronted by individuals who wish to voice their concerns or complaints outside of the Board room. Trustees should listen to the individual’s concerns but politely explain the chain of command for addressing complaints and direct the individual to communicate concerns to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The Superintendent will then redirect the individual to the appropriate district employee. Most often when the individual understands who to request information from, he or she is able to resolve the issue without entering into the formal process. A Trustee should not get overly involved in a matter that may come before the Board as a complaint in order to preserve the Trustee’s unbiased judgment. An overly biased Trustee may need to recuse himself or herself from hearing the Level III grievance.</p>
